It uses standard HTTP response codes to indicate request's response status. To use the API you must obtain an API key, see Authentication section. There are two main endpoints, one retrieving current news headlines, another for searching over all indexed articles.</p><div class='apiKey mt-3'><h3>Your API Key</h3><div><input disabled value='01qv*&Ddshk35tqa8gerus' type='text' /><button></button></div></div><hr /><h2>Quick Start</h2><p>The easiest way to start using the API is to install our client library, or to make requests using curl or any other command line utility, see examples page.
