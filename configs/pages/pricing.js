        answer: "Yes (in almost every case) the API provides the full body content for each article. You are permitted to use the body of the content for internal purposes (ie. analysis or event detection) only. Perigon is committed to protecting the copyrights of journalists and media sources, so you cannot reprint, replicate, or republish the articleâ€™s content without proper permission from the originating source."

These include major organizations like CNN, Fox News, Reuters, ABC News, New York Post, NBC News, CBS News, Newsweek, and The New York Times. There are also thousands of specialized sources available, like TechCrunch, ESPN, Snopes, Politico, Gadget, Refinery29, NPR, and others. Our solutions also provide access to thousands of local news outlets and broadcasters from around the world.

        answer: "Weâ€™re happy to explore additional sources for paid plans. Thereâ€™s typically no cost for requesting the addition of new sources, assuming that they can easily be supported and there is a low number of them. If you have a large number of sources that youâ€™d like to add, or if the sources require more of a custom integration, then we can develop a custom plan to meet your needs. Please email data@goperigon.com with your requirements and a representative will be happy to look into what can be done."
