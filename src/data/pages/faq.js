    { question: "How’s Gawq different?", answer: "Lorem ipsum, dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Minus facilis similique possimus nesciunt, doloribus ullam perferendis necessitatibus quos deleniti placeat cumque eius nam vitae esse inventore. Ullam sit aperiam deleniti!" },
    { question: "Is Gawq free?", answer: "Yes, Gawq is entirely free. Version one is available for both Apple iOS and Android. The app is optimized for mobile and tablet devices." },
    { question: "What’s the business model?", answer: "Our first priority is to build the right user experience. In doing so, we didn't want the distractions that often come with commercialization. Inevitably, we'll need to find a business model to support our growth and continued innovation. Whatever path we decide to take, we'll make sure that our model clearly aligns with the greater mission of Gawq, and that it doesn't run the risk of recreating many of the problems that exist in today's media landscape." },
    { question: "Is there a political bias?", answer: "Gawq does not write or produce the news. Instead, we focus on building technology that makes it easier for you to stay informed without the concern of mystery algorithms under the hood. Many of our features are designed to provide 360 coverage across sources that have varying perspectives. We do not hand-pick what you see or use technology that sorts content based on your likelihood to engage. The feeds on Gawq either sort by recency or - in the case of headlines - the amount of recent coverage for a given story." },
    { question: "Why’s it called ‘Gawq’?", answer: "We're all guilty of gawking at our phone and clicking those sensational headlines. Our brand exists because of this problem, and we want to send a subtle reminder each and every time you click to open the app. Making strides toward a solution always starts with awareness of the problem itself. The 'Q' in our name is because we want people to ask questions, and to examine the quality of the information they consume." },
    { question: "How’s Gawq funded?", answer: "The company is founded by Joshua Dziabiak, a serial entrepreneur and investor from Austin, TX. Joshua has invested six-figures of his own money to create the first version of Gawq. Given the size and scope of our mission, we may engage outside investment to help support our growth. If and when we engage investors, it will be important that their objectives and investment strategies align with our values and vision for the company." },
    { question: "Who’s behind Gawq?", answer: "The company is founded by Joshua Dziabiak, a serial entrepreneur and investor from Austin, TX. You can read more about Joshua's background on his LinkedIn profile. There are currently no institutional investors or other shareholders in the company. Almost 100% of the product and brand design was completed by Joshua himself. The engineering has been supported by several (incredible) contract developers, a couple of which work full-time for Gawq. Community moderation is largely supported by volunteers. If you're passionate about improving the media landscape, we'd love to hear from you!" },
    { question: "Which media sources are supported?", answer: "Gawq supports over 150 media sources. These include major organizations like CNN, Fox News, ABC News, New York Post, NBC News, CBS News, Newsweek, and The New York Times. There are also dozens of specialized media sources available, like TechCrunch, ESPN, Snopes, Politico, Gadget, Refinery29, NPR, and others. To avoid overwhelming you with content, we do not automatically activate every source when you first register. You can enable, disable, or simply view the full list of available sources inside the 'Content controls' section under your account. If you'd like to request a new source to be added, please email support@gawq.com. We'd love to hear from you!" },
    { question: "What about local news?", answer: "It's coming soon! We plan to add local news in early 2021." },
